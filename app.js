// pseudo code 

//get document ready 

// setting up array of animals 

var aniamls = [];

//once document has been loaded, do the following:

//loop thru array items and make them into buttons 

//I think we'd have to also add the val attribute as well 


//user clicks on button, call API to return 10 gifs 

//display the gif image 
//display the gif rating 


// for each gif 
    // click to pause
    //OOH double click to start it 


//form when they submit an animal 

//add that to the array of buttons 
//make the button display on the screen 
//similar to the above, when that button is clicked, call api to return 10 gifts

//nice to have -when mouse is on a button, change it's color
